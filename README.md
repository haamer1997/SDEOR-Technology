# SD-EOR
MS Thesis Simulation Codes for SD-EOR Technology

The following provides a summary for each folder within this repository.
(1) 3D-pEDFM Validation for Conductive NFs: it contains validation cases for 3D-pEDFM code for multiple conductive fractures occurring at different lengths, orientations, and numbers.
(2) CompositionalFns: it has two updated MATLAB files about compositional fluids used and simulation equations.
(3) Diffusion Models for Primary System: it validates different diffusion models against matrix permeability and grid refinement. 
(4) ECLIPSE Diffusion for SD-EOR: this folder contains simulation validation cases for ECLIPSE diffusion equation for SD-EOR under different grid refinement, injection rates and pressures, and matrix permeability.
(5) Investigating Numerical Dispersion: this folder studies numerical dispersion developed under different grid resolutions to further distinguish physical diffusion contribution.
(6) Maxwell-Stefan Diffusion Codes (OMO): it contains original Maxwell-Stefan computational codes compatible with MRST environment with a validation simulation case, originally written by Dr. Olufemi Olorode.
(7) OMO Comments on SPEJ: this folder contains different simulation cases based on comments received from Dr. Olufemi about SPE J "A novel EOR technology in tight rocks).
(8) OMO Original SD-EOR Codes: this folder has the original codes for SD-EOR upon which different simulation cases are based.
(9) Percolation Threshold Calculation: this folder contains simulation codes to calculate percolation threshold and perform NF sensitivity analysis for both conductive and non-conductive NFs.
(10) SD-EOR CMG Diffusion Cases: this folder validates CMG dispersion and diffusion modeling in SD-EOR against MRST implementation.
(11) SD-EOR Sensitivity Study: this folder has simulation codes to evaluate SD-EOR perfromance under long-term production and different solvent injection methods.
(12) Trial cases for SD-EOR Diffusion Modeling: this folder combines all my previous attempts to model diffusion in SD-EOR under different schemes, including negligible injection pressure, linear solver, gridding, injection rates, and different fluids.
(13) utils: it has auxiliary files required to run my simulation codes.
(14) Validating CMG Diffusion Modeling in Primary Systems: this folder has simulation codes to validate MRST diffusion/dispersion modeling against CMG for a primary gas system.
